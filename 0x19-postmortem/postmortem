# Postmortem: Database Service Disruption

## Issue Summary
On March 15, 2024, our database service experienced an unexpected outage from 3:00 PM to 6:45 PM GMT+1, significantly impacting user experience. Approximately 75% of users encountered difficulties with account operations and data retrieval due to slow response times and timeouts. The root cause was a misconfigured database migration script, leading to excessive memory consumption and service disruption.

## Timeline
- **3:00 PM**: Outage begins.
- **3:05 PM**: Automated monitoring alerts for abnormal memory usage.
- **3:10 PM**: SRE team begins investigation, suspecting a memory leak.
- **3:30 PM**: Increase in user complaints reported; impact becomes apparent.
- **4:00 PM**: Application update deemed unrelated; rollback initiated.
- **4:45 PM**: Incident escalated to database administration for further investigation.
- **5:15 PM**: Flawed migration script identified.
- **6:45 PM**: Database service restored after script optimization and server reboot.

## Root Cause and Resolution
The outage stemmed from a misconfigured migration script lacking proper memory management, causing a surge in memory usage beyond infrastructure capacity. Resolution involved optimizing the script and rebooting the server to clear the memory bottleneck.

## Corrective and Preventative Measures
### Improvements
- Establish more rigorous code review processes, particularly for critical infrastructure scripts.

### Tasks
- Update database server with latest security patches and performance enhancements.
- Enhance monitoring capabilities to include detailed database performance metrics.
- Review all existing and future migration scripts for memory management issues.
- Initiate continuous education program for engineering teams on database management best practices.

This postmortem underscores our commitment to service reliability and performance standards. By learning from this incident and implementing proactive measures, we aim to fortify our systems against future challenges.
